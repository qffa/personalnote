带问号（?）的 SQL 语句

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE productCode = ?;
```

>Since the prepared statement uses placeholders (?), this helps avoid many variants of SQL injection hence make your application more secure.


## 使用方法


First, prepare a statement that returns the product code and name of a product specified by product code:

```
PREPARE stmt1 FROM
	'SELECT
   	    productCode,
            productName
	FROM products
        WHERE productCode = ?';
```

Second, declare a variable named pc, stands for product code, and set its value to 'S10_1678':

```
SET @pc = 'S10_1678';
```

Third, execute the prepared statement:

```
EXECUTE stmt1 USING @pc;
```

Fourth, assign the pc variable another product code:

```
SET @pc = 'S12_1099';
```

Fifth, execute the prepared statement with the new product code:

```
EXECUTE stmt1 USING @pc;
```

Finally, release the prepared statement:

```
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt1;
```
